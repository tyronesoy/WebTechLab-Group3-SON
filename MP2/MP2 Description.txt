MP2: TeaChair - Creating a seat plan manually can sometimes be both time consuming and frustrating for an instructor. That's why we created TeaChair to make it easier just by downloading different layouts (e.g. Laboratory, Lecture) where you can add, delete, edit the name of students on each box, who are enrolled on that class. Through this application we can guarantee that the instructor will surely save time.
